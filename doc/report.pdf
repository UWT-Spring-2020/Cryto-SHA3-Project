SHA3 LIBRARY & APP (JAVA)

THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED USING MOSTLY BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
WITHIN THE JAVA LIBRARY AND AS PER INSTRUCTED FROM NIST
WEBSITE FOR SHA3 ALGORITHM (BOTH CSHAKE256 AND KMACXOF256
IMPLEMENTATION) AND ITS SUBSEQUENT FUNCTIONS.

THIS PROJECT ALLOWS USER TO ENCRYPT/DECRYPT ANY FILE, TEXT INPUT
OR MIXED MEDIA USING SHA3 HASHING ALGORITHM, WITH OPTIONS OF
ATTACHING A PASSPHRASE OR ELLIPTIC KEY-PAIR FOR ADDED SECURITY.
FURTHERMORE, USERS ARE ABLE TO SIGN//WRITE SIGNATURES TO FILE
AND DECIDE OWN THEIR OWN PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY BEFORE RUNNING
THE HASHING FUNCTIONS. 

OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF DATA, WHILE TRANSFERRING
AND UP TO WHEN THE RECEPIANT DECRYPT YOUR HEAVILY ELLIPTIC-ENCRYPTED FILE.
WE WENT THE EXTRA MILE IN OUR DESIGN TO PROVIDE AN EASY AND COMPLETE
EXECUTION OF OUR PROGRAM, SO PLEASE ENJOY OUR FIRST-EVER CRYTOGRAPHIC APP.
